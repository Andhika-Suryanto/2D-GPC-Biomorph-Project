## 🔴About
**Biomorph** is a 2D platformer that combines smooth mechanics with a focus on exploration and treasure collection. In a vibrant, ever-changing world, players are tasked with collecting coins and diamonds scattered across dynamic, obstacle-filled levels.

The gameplay features versatile movement options, including double jumping to reach higher platforms, wall holding to pause and strategize mid-air, and wall jumping to navigate narrow passages and climb vertical surfaces. Without the stress of enemies, the game focuses entirely on mastering movement and discovering hidden treasures.

Biomorph offers a relaxing yet engaging platforming experience, challenging players to perfect their skills while uncovering every secret in its colorful world.
